This app is a browser extension (STILL NOT FINISHED). 

It allows you to covertly search ChatGPT via its API, highlighting the text and then displaying the answer on screen. 

To use it, just add an unpackaged extension to your browser, then highlight the text. 

Once the text has been highlighted, just wait for the response to be generated, which will appear on the screen.
